# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
#car1 = Car.create(type: "caravan", color: "blue", price: "30 000")
#car2 = Car.create(type: "jeep", color: "gold", price: "45 000")
